Acme::CPANModules::DescribeAModuleBadly::* modules should contain lists of
modules that are being described badly. Inspired by Jimmy Fallon's Twitter
hashtag #DescribeAMovieBadly (Feb 4, 2020), the idea is to give an accurate
description of a certain element or aspect of the module but somehow miss the
whole point of it.
